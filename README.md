# üõí Supermarket Monitor

A simple scraper + alerting system that monitors **online supermarket websites** for product prices and promotions.  

It uses headless Chromium to extract data from category/product pages (Puppeteer locally, serverless-compatible Chromium on Vercel), stores results in LibSQL (remote) or SQLite (local), and optionally notifies you via Telegram when your favourite items are on sale.

## Quick start

1) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set values.

2) Install deps and run in dev:

```
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm run dev
```

3) Add Sklavenitis product URLs to watchlist:

```
npm run watch:add -- --url "https://www.sklavenitis.gr/katigories/.../product" --name "Milk 1L" --target 1.20
```

4) On each run, the job fetches current prices for all watchlisted items, stores them in `price_history`, and sends Telegram alerts when targets are met or price drops occur.
